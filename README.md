# clutter mitigation techniques

The code in this repository covers the following three papers:

1. Turek, J.S.; Yavneh, I.; Elad, M., “Clutter Mitigation in Echocardiography using Sparse Signal Separation”, International Journal in Biomedical Imaging, 2015.

2. Turek, J.S.; Elad, M.; Yavneh, I., “Sparse Signal Separation with an Off-line Learned Dictionary for Clutter Reduction in Echocardiography”, IEEE 28-th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel (IEEEI), Dec. 2014.

3. Turek, J.S.; Sulam, J.; Elad, M.; Yavneh, I.,”Fusion of Ultrasound Harmonic Imaging with Clutter Removal Using Sparse Signal Separation”, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2015), Apr. 2015.


## Requirements:
Please install the Field II simulator to create the synthetic images.
In addition you need to download the (complex OMP and k-SVD toolbox)[http://bit.ly/comptoolbox]
